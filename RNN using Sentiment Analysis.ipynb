They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"Xtds3h0lIbBj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651516466675,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Aniket Daware","userId":"01158157021048506648"}},"outputId":"c3c6538d-e05b-475f-ec4c-881dc9bf78f0"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                              review sentiment\n","0  One of the other reviewers has mentioned that ...  positive\n","1  A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The...  positive\n","2  I thought this was a wonderful way to spend ti...  positive\n","3  Basically there's a family where a little boy ...  negative\n","4  Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is...  positive"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-0b4f1b69-3602-4ab6-9b9f-f8fd61005c23\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>review</th>\n","      <th>sentiment</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>One of the other reviewers has mentioned that ...</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>A wonderful little production. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The...</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>I thought this was a wonderful way to spend ti...</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Basically there's a family where a little boy ...</td>\n","      <td>negative</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is...</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-0b4f1b69-3602-4ab6-9b9f-f8fd61005c23')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-0b4f1b69-3602-4ab6-9b9f-f8fd61005c23 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word br br it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an

wouldn t dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance oz doesn t mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldn t say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who ll be sold out for

very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece br br the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great master s of comedy and his life br br the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets

be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the corniness bad special effects etc but i was pleasantly surprised not to say that it s the best vampire movie i have ever seen but it certainly isn t the worst i liked the whole alternate reality dream state that played into the movie the graphics were quite well for a straight to dvd movie and i liked the overall look of the film i enjoyed the main character sai i usually end up hating the female leads but there was something about her that kept me interested yes she does make some bad decisions but that was to be expected yes the other characters were stereotypical but i was expecting that too i don t know if i d highly recommend this movie but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised i m putting this one on my guilty

on how much tv has been needing a creative original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show that is unlike the rest where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows such as scrubs and house you would see the similarities and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity br br with a magnificent cast wonderful script and hilarity in every episode

i enjoyed the film rich roesing who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box are well justified i did not have the

the movie kept me guessing until the very end i was surprised by the ending br br the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian yet conflictual side of police work the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition br br if you like suspense films but also like films that expound on the character s feeling personal inflection side this film is for you br br should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system s guide watch it br br however if you are looking for a rental video follow rich roesing s advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it'\n"," b'john boorman s 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback though it s hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a m nage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesn t get it instead it s lumbered with what may well be brendan gleeson s worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there s nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but it s at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics br br there s a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the general and his men painting them as anti social drug dealers purely because cahill won t share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we re expected to find lovably cheeky that it s just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then it s too late to really care adrian dunbar maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but jon voight s hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance overcompensating for gleeson s comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire come back zardoz all is forgiven'\n"," b'i waited until the 4th of july to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day br br in 1924 d w griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm 1921 he d been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution dar who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn t a trace of patrick henry anywhere br br we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague carol dempster a leading lady for griffith for many years complicating matters is the fact that nancy s father hates nathan well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan s arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy s dad br br paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire br br comparisons with birth of a nation 1915 are inevitable the montague family might just as well be the cameron s from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army in this case the redcoats storming a trench packed with patriots the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man s land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isn t scope g w billy bitzer s camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is dare i say it sincerity br br the brutality of capt butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen don t expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance 1916 in one scene butler s second in command capt hare louis wolhiem gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on hare s face as he obviously has a good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912 a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d w knowing the reputation of his famous family said i am not hiring stage actors to which lionel replied and i am nothing of the kind sir he makes a very good and quite believable villain louis wolhiem appeared with lionel s older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr jekyll and mr hyde both 1920 and later in the tempest 1927 as capt hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also br br neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and i was scared to death he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually waned br br speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere s ride he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce to arms the regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground i am amazed griffith did not do another take br br so is america a classic yes don t wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime'\n"," b'as if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school i read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film and for better or worse and i ve now read and taught the novel for over three decades milo o shea is still leopold bloom'\n"," b'this version is pretty insipid i m afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william hurt s weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt i also can t believe that they eliminated edward s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the 70 s version with george c scott and susannah york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched rochester s character the way that scott did'\n"," b'when i was young i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud and i think its great leslie nielson s awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways it s one goofy show br br one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits i think my favorite one is when norberg not o j walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame classic br br the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes i know i think they used it too many times by whatever br br good acting good gags great show br br 7 10'\n"," b'i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1 2 years ago the vhs print was a little faded looking but i was very haunted by what i had watched did it all make sense well honestly no it didn t however this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression br br well when i found out that anchor bay had released this oddity on dvd i picked it up immediately i was very pleased by the transfer though i felt the extras rather lacking though the film concerns the o and sir stephen characters it really has nothing to do with pauline reage s original novel or the 1974 film the story of o however the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind o decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men naturally sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress however the tables are turned when o actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer suddenly sir stephen feels the threat br br i feel that the deep meaning behind the film including the tragic score and artistic direction really make this film a classic the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of o s fellow brothel mates but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored like the political setting the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging no one is happy in the film even if they believe that they are however o does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer one prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress she cannot let that vision go she treats her clients as co stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river br br as for o she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle when he leaves she feels a sense of abandonment of course in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father i was very very disturbed by this image i truly felt for o at this point in the film she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love br br another curious aspect of the film is the young child that ages at the end that sells fortune in a box it is a very random character but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film at one point the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people now if that isn t symbolism for you laugh br br all in all i really love this film i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience it has erotic scenes but the scenes aren t really meant to arouse like the lives of the characters the sex acts are empty they are motions but lack feeling and tenderness once again the only tender scene is between o and the young man o believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor however she finds in the end that she has choices she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness however she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions however some things don t need answers the viewer will make the judgment that works for them br br i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score there is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music'\n"," b'i have read the book and i must say that this movie stays true to form i think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of psycho cristina raines gives an excellent performance as the lead and burgess meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next door neighbor i have seen this movie at least twice and i think that i am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection the suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end the twist you will never see coming if you like movies like signs and the village the sentinel will be a classic prelude also what is interesting is

not agatha s mistake the cast isn t good the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45 woman in the iraqi desert the victim is not likable'\n"," b'back in the 1960 s those of us who were bad movie aficionados thought that plan nine from outer space was the worst movie ever made and would remain so for all time to put things in perspective though we also thought that 3 000 was a lot to pay for a new car br br as we grew older our innocence was gradually stripped away as we were exposed to movies like hercules in new york and overdrawn at the memory bank which completely redefined the bad movie genre in this context last night my son and i saw alien from l a which pushed the envelope to an extreme unimaginable just a generation ago to call this movie bad or wretched or execrable completely fails to do it justice as does any other label existent in the english language even if there were words with which to accurately describe this movie it would be of no consequence since they would be banned in civilized society br br the alien referred to in the title is played by kathy ireland who apparently took some time off from modeling swimsuits for sports illustrated to kick off her cinematic career her casting might seem some sort of recommendation until you actually see the movie the makeup artists earned their money by making kathy look so drab and unappetizing you would not want to touch her with the far end of a broomstick no mean feat to put it bluntly in this movie she has a face that would freeze medusa even worse than her look though was her voice which was so raucous that i initially failed to credit it as originating with a human being throughout the movie i found myself longing for a chalkboard to drag my nails across to cover the screechy twang of her dialog at the end of the movie kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit i suggested to my son that the movie would have been better if they had put her in the swimsuit at the beginning of the movie so at least we would have had something to watch my son perceptively pointed out that if they had then removed the swimsuit and stuffed it into her mouth it would have considerably improved the movie on two counts i defer to the plain brilliance of his observation if you have any doubts compare this dreck to barbarella in which a competent filmmaker shows how to exploit the assets of an ethereally beautiful leading lady in the fantasy genre br br of the plot itself there is little on which to comment since there was so little in evidence it is said that if a million monkeys typed unceasingly for millions of years eventually one would come up with hamlet by the process of elimination the rest of the time they would come up with something approximating this screenplay imagine if you will a modern day alice falling into a hole and dropping 500 feet onto a rock slab following which she gets up dusts herself off and starts looking for her long lost father in the city kingdom of atlantis once in atlantis she spends most of her time running fighting or climbing stairs and ladders and basically trying to keep out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to do his bidding and who would make tiny tim look macho this summation as abbreviated as it appears is probably longer than the shooting script br br on the plus side as you revel in the production values and take in whatever you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and haze you realize that this is one movie in which you can actually see on the screen where all 20 of the budget went br br the thought that kept going through my mind was that filmmakers ought not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they are shooting a movie or perhaps prior if it leads to results like alien from l a though in fairness i have to acknowledge that i don t know whether they were actually involved in substance abuse or were simply brain dead at the outset of the project'\n"," b'there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box office failures andaz apna apna an

out steps simon danny glover to take the truck away both men are threatened but simon manages to get himself mack and the car out of dire straits it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier you see simon s sister deborah tina lifford is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretary s friend jane alfre woodard br br this is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above mary louise parker as well as mack s wife mary mcdonnel who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto jeremy sisto in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story br br the director lawrence kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill has created a splendid movie here the cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that would ve made the film even stronger are glossed over the story involving the secretary is one and the second involving simon s nephew is the other these scenes should ve been more apart of the entire story and then maybe lawrence kasdan s views of life between the upper and lower classes would ve been more on a superior level instead of just very good still grand canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named

with the help of sam the film s wonderfully unlikely hero a lobotomized african american boheomouth played by an actor named bill mcghee who was sadly robbed of a supporting oscar nomination for his turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy sam s one wish is to have someone help him put his prized toy boat in the water and his continual asking of the various female cast members to do so and his nonstop consumption of chocolate popsicles as some kind of underlying theme though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up there is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients but i ll leave the details of that to your discovery br br ms holotik arrives just as dr stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy professionalism of ms masters who reluctantly allows the leggy young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened oh

the plot cannot control and who s antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies murders that ultimately take place in this dark old creepy house in the middle of nowhere br br the house itself is a wonderful set with a threadbare early 1970 s decor that is remarkable in it s unremarkableness with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting the house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors twisting confined stairways secreted closets and passageways leading to the different larger areas and of course the basement mentioned in the title visited only once but boy it sure proves to be a doozy i love the frosted old freezer where sam keeps his stash of popsicles the utterly plain exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year force us to swelter in the heat everyone is covered with beads of persperation and looks exhausted and even the ever cheerful sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening though he cannot understand what it all means and rosie h is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened and while ms holotik s limitations of an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her big revelation scene she s a great screamer when all hell starts to break loose and brownrigg indulged of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of undress that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract stipulated too bad br br the real show stealer is sam however and fans of what i have been taught to refer to as splatter cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale and there is something moving about how sam runs to the protection of

directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board the nightmare man though is on the whole a succinctly better crafted piece that builds its plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor characters time is given to giving them all a firm background the island setting is perhaps a genre clich that has been used over and over but its one that i enjoy very much the remoteness the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to camfield he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times there is an authenticity about proceedings the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point if there is one negative about the killer its that we are given his her its pov for the killings an acceptable clich on its own but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer given the clues presented but it s a fun and very well acted piece the local scottish cast are exceptional the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold imrie never one i ve taken to in other works is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production the outlandish maybe even preposterous ending may irk some

the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done br br the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p huntley jr as lt queen s own butler it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor'\n"," b'it s hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film the story is predictable when not completely laughable it s all a matter of dutiful gestures which as presented here carry absolutely no conviction yes the mgm production values are gorgeous and yes ms lamarr was exquisitely beautiful but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no chemistry together and that s the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective it s my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released the passage of time has not improved it'\n"," b'the french either make pro marxist films or anti marxist films with a few in between merci pour le chocolat is the latter of this genre from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension it is an old man s film with an excess of 40 s plus people it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer the plot is not only banal but preposterous how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity in truth their is no tenable plot at all it is riddle with holes like a good piece of french cheese br br whether intentional or not it is a film about the bourgeoisie at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene i concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn t have used a steady cam in this film it would have woke them all up other than it being a nonsense story the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss

shedding a false tear for a scene smirking she says like they do in the american actor s studio i think miss huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor s studio br br if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when huppert remarks we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film br br safety medical note in the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage this should never be done only cold water should

t speak russian i m sure funny how people miss the point the no goodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great

this movie as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan the what you can t watch a wierd black and white movie with little to no dialogue defense does not apply i simply can t watch terrible weird black and white movies with little to no dialogue br br this movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget and let him her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible it was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long assuming it should exist at all shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes because the director has i just love the sound of my own voice syndrome and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of god the opening scene of the film joy i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape after at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around twitching on a rope by a gang of cloaked mystery men i knew it was time to give up rarely do i give up on a movie i sat through the entirety of blair witch 2 book of shadows albeit not happily this did not deserve the 20 minutes i gave it br br if you re an eraserhead fan do not let simple minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash

ripped off an old show s title then destroyed the nostalgia with boring re imagined stuff the 60 s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time a good natured satire of super hero comic books the character was drawn as 1 2 way between animal and human the way mickey mouse is here they use a real beagle that s about the same as making a mickey mouse watch with a real rat br br most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film instead we get a clumsy ex police dog who s even dumber than cad and some pet owners who add nothing to the story cheesy effects the dog talking animation is embarrassing poor scripting a stereotyped dwarf playing simon bar sinister the gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice underdog is painful you d think they d at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate wally cox s humorously distinctive voice for underdog but no there are at least a few affectionate references to the source material such as the rhyming lines which lift it to a 4 br br only small children that love dogs may enjoy this everybody else should get a dvd of the original cartoon series watch this only in desperation'\n"," b'vincent

in the office environment is it that he s just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines br br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justified br br finally it is a film full of great moments both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is

of the most interesting roman emperors lucius domitius ahenobarbus better known as nero although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate nero than the amusing but completely fictitious nero peter ustinov played in quo vadis it still is a major failure and to those imdb commentators who still believe that sueton and tacitus propaganda is true please read a book about nero that was published less than 20 years ago nero did not burn rome this is proved he did not murder britannicus he did not torture kill and maim for pleasure he was the first emperor who banned the gladiator fights the movie still shows a lot of mistakes errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing the palace looking like some villa the city itself looked like well like a cheap set the acting was between good and sub par the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after nero became emperor to a rushed bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure so there still is the potential for an epic biography of nero that shows the true nero who was one of the best emperors who ruled rome despite the lies of sueton et al'\n"," b'i was unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80 s i was born on may 14th 1994 despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80 s when other kids had playstations i was playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i because of my 80 s style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn t see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too br br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk s adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at a local caf the chipmunks are playing a game of around the world in 30 days against the chipettes brittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin get s in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team s likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive a 100 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it s also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting lucky kind of suggestive for a kid s film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky i first didn t think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince s men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it s one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100 000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to black br br classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you haven t seen this flick give it a watch it s worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80 s gets a solid 10 out of 10 br br headin for the top don t you know we never stop believing now'\n"," b'this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house it s a very positive and happy type of music the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy gary

much about buddy holly until i watched this movie i ve been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn t give much attention to it until i watched this movie it s an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie'\n"," b'just another example of why stepehn king s books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great i ve seen the major characters in movies where they were much better'\n"," b'a young couple mandy pullman mitch martin

nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending i ve ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly as the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes but none are shown on screen there is only one gore scene in the entire film too the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes everything about this film production wise is very static and flat the film has no energy or pace the acting is dull and you don t feel or care for anyone check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions the type of rubbish horror film making that you ll forget within a day a real waste of time don t bother'\n"," b'i ve seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope a little cheer a bit of a release from my everyday life and this is what i got you can be critical of the acting the singing and dialog but that t not what i look for when i go to a movie i look for a little release from my daily life a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life where people love another and help another it s a shame we can t we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade essay this may be very simplistic but really wouldn t it be nice'\n"," b'anyone who rates this movie above a 3 has a very distorted view

thought about this film i find it s far too easy to dismiss this as the boy s dream i have actually received some spiritual strength from northfork angels do exist we definitely are entertained by

to get to heaven br br being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff i found this film to be genuine cinema all i can say is it touched me in so many ways that i still am sorting it all out north fork is a wonderful film one that brings the viewer s mind out of the gutter and into the heart the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me pay attention as you ll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story i think it s possibly a bit over the heads of some but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly i want to view it several more times just so i can take it all in br br the industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist br br my thanks to all involved in the making of this film'\n"," b'this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes'\n"," b'just see it it s a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time see it more than once everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling sensation or tone the clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops crackles hisses and barely audible sounds the structure is non linear and cyclical motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise expectations regarding plot and character are broken signaling a non traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity this is a part of a review usa the movie is emotionally intense intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing in surprising and unconventional ways dion

newspaper tv listings described it as such i ll not laugh out loud at that because it s easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala this is spinal tap br br what seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker mark borchardt who is how can i put it rather self deluded yes but that s not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we d all still be living in caves and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam raimi yes that one and peter jackson yes that one both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it s not a criticism no it s just that mark borchardt yes that one is a parody of american trailer trash br br remember in there s something about mary ben stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker come into my office because you re f in fired well that s who mark resembles along with most of jerry springer s guests so it s very easy to see why some people thought this wasn t a real documentary it s also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps did you know that someone thought mark would grow up to be a serial killer does anyone else think there s plenty of time left for this to happen'\n"," b'i ve just finished listening to the director s commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like mann s the insider is completely subjective it s from howard s pov so any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it as ebert did is really about nolte s character actually if you feel as he did that the film does not work then you re saying i think that howard does not work and to be frank you might be right howard s reasoning and personality really wouldn t stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis br br but hey that s the nature of people br br andrew'\n"," b'i though this would be an okay movie since i like zombies and horror movies in general but i did not think it would be such a piece of sh t like it was the only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car the movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors i wouldn t ever call them actors the costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters there is no fun at all in this piece of sh t only horror but not in the way the director intended i would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again ugh'\n"," b'those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson s alter ego elvira then this is a good place to start br br elvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money br br unfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock br br the film is actually pretty funny with peterson a k a elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and don t forget tomorrow we re showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course'\n"," b'this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering the acting wasn t the greatest i ll admit that but it was passionate about it s message sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual they even had a damn trial for saddam so why doesn t every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place i m getting off the movie but i think it s worthy to note about this sick twisted idea the government has the movie s way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery the whole movie i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it s made very obvious in the end there s no doubt that the directing was incredible but the one thing i didn t care for was that there wasn t as much emphasis on reese witherspoon s character s interest and fight in the ideal she held a lot of skipping otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played'\n"," b'there is something in most of us especially guys that admires some really working class small town real men populist fare and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top hey a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy but i don t rate movies or actor directors based on politics or personality that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since br br okay you have the gist of this there is this good cop a small town trooper joe played against type by david morse who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars the bad guy stops gets out shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man s parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone so we know that joe the farmer forced off his land into a cop job is a good basic sort of guy then his brother frank shows up he is a sadistic amoral bully fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off then there is mom and dad marsha mason and charles bronson who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple then die off she by illness and he by shotgun suicide to advance the story for us both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife but joe has a nice wife played by italian actress valeria golina who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut for me that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool br br but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend s car robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them br br so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate except for the 60 s era effect to win the hearts of old hippies the worst offense is that since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song the highway patrolman that song was not included br br so joe s brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim s spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife the bartender is good ole ceasar played by dennis hopper so viggo frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves br br so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50 s junker on some lonely road at night and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence oy such dreck then to top off this drecky sap fest there is some zen crap about the indian runner who is a messenger becomes the message ala marshall macluhen see what i mean sean has done much better than this so don t be afraid to miss this one'\n"," b'don t waste your time one of those cool looking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a hunch but not even worth that you will not say it s so bad it s good just it s bad the greatest american hero is a writer who rents a cabin on african island called snake island some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off but they are not staying on the island they just stop there to let off the writer then the boat is stranded there and in true hollywood originality the one and only radio on the island is busted so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes like hundreds of them which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere it s not like there ever was one main snake like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes instead there are just a bunch of ham and egger snakes of all kinds of breeds their only goal then was to escape the island as opposed to having to conquer the enemy because there were so many snakes you knew they couldn t possibly try to kill them all and they didn t try i ve seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending in snake island by the way every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island duhhhhh it s named snake island for a reason there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat oh they never do get gas by the way they just happen to find another boat on the island already gassed up'\n"," b'surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season i can honestly say i modified

well enough to play off of the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick devito characters work best when depraved his character portrayed as a writing hack would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are his character would in real life have a great agent and multiple solicitations the characters are one dimensional which is okay in comedy but crystals s character is not written very well his desire to kill the moma all of a sudden makes no sense at all it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor the pitiful attempts are not too often and the movie flows fairly well'\n"," b'definitely a must see for all fans of film noir br br thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller br br wonderful characterizations articulate the movie s powerful message of racial and religious tolerance it s difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn t a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling br br making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage now all these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it s refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like crossfire br br another low budget gem from the hollywood archives'\n"," b'oh how i laughed during those first couple of scenes this silly little film about an 11 year old who carries a gun steals cars robs stores burglars houses extorts money from other kids burns houses shoots rats buys drugs distributes drugs to his mother and his friends and then kills a guy what a great comedy but it wasn t intended to be a comedy it was intended as a social drama how can this be the events in this film are absurd and ridiculous the characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year old s comic strip induced immature imagination the dialog is laughable people talk like morons it s a very dumb film br br the first scenes are indeed very funny for all the wrong reasons but the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while and after that the laughs come only rarely by that time the viewer can t believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows if he has at least half a brain cell br br a short film but feels like an eternity the film actually is a seriously intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate while imitating movies vastly superior to it like fun there is just such an air of phoniness about everything the kids the adults everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog the kid in the lead mugs his way through the film as though he had seen all the jimmy cagney movies at least a hundred times and typically enough the kid isn t portrayed as a reservoir of evil but instead as a misunderstood little artistic talent but of course every young hooligan is misunderstood society made him bad poor child br br the film is embarrassing a collection of stale occasionally hilarious clich s put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning the intellectual level of the film is zero']\n","-----------------------\n","label:  [1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n"," 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1

want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive i managed to watch the whole doggone disgrace of a film this movie brings a low to original ideas yes it was original thus my 2 stars instead of 1 are our film writers that uncreative that they can only come up with this acting was horrible and the characters were unlikeable for the most part the lead lady in the story had no good qualities at all they made her bf into some sort of a bad guy and i did not see that at all maybe i missed something i do not know he was the most down to earth relevant character in the movie i did not shell out any money for this garbage i almost wish peta would come to the rescue of this awful offensive movie and form a protest disgusting thats all i have to say anymore'\n"," b'i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn t understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he s a pretty good actor i only see him getting better br br it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don t really care to watch another episode br br i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities'\n"," b'when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called mausolem instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about i will be honest i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree however there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie i was expecting'\n"," b'like many others i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time i was sadly mistaken everything negative said about this flic is more than true what takes the cake however is the horrible horrible storyline for the main character br br here s why the planet might be destroyed the only way to recover from it for the entire human race to be saved trough it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground hide out and dennis hopper is the lone seer scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this but what s the main motivation of stevens sonny d angelo he s angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at the hopper character was the boy with the finger in the dike and now stevens is blaming him for picking and choosing and if that isn t enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isn t fair and he s responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity s saviour oh my god how stupid can you get br br what s also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap i mean two million in budget what could have been done with that think clerks blair witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100 000 dollars and were still better aaaaargh i count myself lucky that i didn t pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter ber crap is one the most heroic things i ve done this year it s no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before'\n"," b'this movie was on t v the other day and i didn t enjoy it at all the first george of the jungle was a good comedy but the sequel completely awful the new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren t good at all they should of had the original actor brendon fraiser and original actress i forgot her name so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought it was good to see ape the ape back but wasn t as fun as the first they should of had the new george as georges son grown up and still had bredon and whats her face in the film that would ve been a bit better then it was'\n"," b'hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn t without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable i know i can t use this word forever but i can t think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn t rank along the best 7 5 10 bethany cox'\n"," b'one crazy summer is the funniest craziest not necessarily the best movie i have ever seen br br just when one crazy scene is done another emerges it never lets you rest just one thing after another the soundtrack is great the songs are the right ones for the scenes br br it is also a clean movie little that is dirty in it br br of course it has the story of the guys you wouldn t trust with your lunch money taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources who d want to see it if they failed there is a serious side in that parents and children do not live up to each others dreams one should always have an open mind and weigh all the options this applies both to parents and children in one crazy summer the parents are wrong this is not always the case'\n"," b'low budget schlockmeister herschell gordon lewis reaches a new low even for him with the gore gore girls a film snicker that possesses all of his technical trademarks badly recorded sound poor lighting and ott gore this would be tolerable even a bit charming if the film at least had an interesting plot blood feast in all its ridiculous glory is a fine example but girls is a total snooze completely unlikable pompous ass private investigator abraham gentry frank kress is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who s been murdering out of shape strippers you ll stop caring who the culprit is long before these two are wrapping up the case as before the appeal isn t the plot but the creative methods of bloodletting including a girl s fanny being tenderized with a wooden mallet and the occasional flashes of then risqu skin but this just isn t enough to elevate the material above tedium'\n"," b'this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete misnomer since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you ve had enough and it s time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end in my case that s two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim'\n"," b'i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the 70s is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clich d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more

quality of the superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film br br the music and lyrics by frank loesser and hoagy carmichael with assistance by flieshcer veteran sammy timberg are quite good but not as much as the scoring of the picture by leigh harline who also scored snow white for disney harline s atmospheric music is superb and a treat for the ears br br the layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it s time and once again the fleischer s background artists outdid themselves the techincolored beauty of the film cannot be denied and while hoppity the grasshopper is the star the characters of swat the fly and smack the mosquito steal the picture swat s voicing by jack mercer of popeye fame is priceless kenny gardner brother in law of guy lombardo and a featured vocalist in his band does his usual pleasant job in the role of dick dickinsen br br the movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons the fleischer studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product the movie is tuneful the story great for all ages and the final scenes of the bugs scrambling for their lives upon a rising skyscraper is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present br br do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film also don t fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of max fleischer s remarkable 3 d sterioptical process which took four months to construct and employed 16 000 tiny panes of glass in the electrified buildings of manhattan br br do not miss mr bug goes to town aka hoppity goes to town i ll wager you ll be bug eyed at the results'\n"," b'this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts and undoubtedly christine mcintyre s best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we don t tire of her voice and partly because it blends so well with the stooges antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle s role in the marx brothers a night at the opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera and mcintyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did the stooges buffoonery mcintyre s singing and a well constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars'\n"," b'this is supposed to be based on wilkie collins the woman in white

corrections and visits a boys reform school the catch is that cagney is not in it for the graft he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their s br br the villain of the piece is dudley digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot one of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations note in the mess hall scene as digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive digges is eating well but the kids are getting quality you wouldn t feed to your pet br br cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam that puts digges back in charge and setting up the film for it s climax br br the mayor of hell was a typical product from the working class studio and because it was pre code it gets pretty gruesome at times a later version of this crime school with humphrey bogart and the dead end kids was a more sanitized remake br br although cagney is fine in the lead role as is madge evans the school nurse the acting honors go to dudley digges hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken but kindly one legged ship s surgeon in mutiny on the bounty but digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he s in br br this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays a whole lot of minorities would be offended

racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr br br what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed s we get insight into ed s personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making br br the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background br br fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story br br ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person s legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement br br even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood s legend br br in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling'\n"," b'having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack

and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a pix sequels br br it s hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost s offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects br br i d strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term br br now only if there was uncle sam 2'\n"," b'i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn t live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling everything about this fell into clich the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid perhaps it could ve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i ve seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that s pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i ve seen was juno so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity i really hope someone decides to either re make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential'\n"," b'this movie is stuffed full of stock horror movie goodies chained lunatics pre meditated murder a mad vaguely lesbian female

the romulans come they will not be bearing gifts no they bring with them war war and conquest as any familiar with this episode know it is a redux of the war film the enemy below from the fifties the obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine or an american destroyer german u boat engaged in lethal war games it is two starships in outer space in trek history about 100 years before the events here according to this episode earth fought the romulan wars after about 5 years of conflict a stalemate brought about a treaty and the institution of the neutral zone a boundary between us and the romulan empire now on this stardate the treaty appears to be broken as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power yes the romulans are back testing their new war toy and kirk must now earn his pay he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy such as figuring out how to avoid a oh i dunno an interstellar war maybe br br i think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn t shy away from the grim aspects of war as one would expect of a mere tv episode from the sixties especially an episode from a science fiction show it s all very tense and gripping like the best war films such as when kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war council the writers and the actors aren t kidding around here this is all preparation for a ghastly conflict potentially the beginning of another years long battleground in the final analysis kirk s aim is to keep this battleground to just the two ships but even then it s an endeavor fraught with peril and probable casualties in fact i believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it right at the start of the episode we see the devastation such battle can produce in that supposedly well protected outpost then begin the cat and mouse war games between the enterprise and the romulan ship it s as exciting as any conflict we ve seen on the big screen of course if you re not into war films you d have to look for other things to admire in this episode br br what elevates this episode even further is the revelation of just what and who the romulans are it s an electric shock of a sort now we have even further inter crew conflict on the bridge of the enterprise war does tend to bring out the worst in some people due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future the tension is ratcheted up even further kirk has his hands full in this one i suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient relenting of the bigotry issue by the conclusion on the romulan side actor lenard makes his first appearance in the trek universe as the romulan commander he s terrific in the role the flip side of capt kirk or capt pike take your pick done up to resemble spock more than a little surprisingly his character is not war hungry as we would expect another eye opener for this episode the actor would next return to this universe as sarek spock s father so he s nothing if not versatile it s also telling how the first appearance of such characters as the romulans is usually their best shot as it is here they showed up in the enterprise incident next'\n"," b'this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up but had never seen it until a few years ago it s reputation truly proceeded it i knew of michael myers had seen the mask saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game and never thought much of the halloween franchise boy how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs br br halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie now by today s standards it isn t as graphic and visceral but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy and the fact that it is set in a quaint mid west town is a testament to his ability the lighting effects are down right horrifying with the shape seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense br br the performances by all the players are well done with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance ms curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her we want her to survive and get away br br donald pleasance plays dr loomis like a man on a mission and it works well he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets br br overall not only is halloween a great horror movie but also a great film it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie and for an even more frightful time try watching it alone with the lights off don t be surprised if you think you see the shape lurking around in the shadows'\n"," b'let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original lonesome dove than i both the pulitzer prize winning book and the towering mini series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving dramatic believable and engrossing works there is no comparison between lonesome dove and any western film at least not since the legendary collaborations of john ford and john wayne it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new mini series what with mcmurtry s non participation and the missing original cast members after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no lonesome dove in almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original but so what i wasn t expecting it to measure up taken as an effort of it s own this film is engaging entertaining and of a very good quality if it were done as a new story not as a sequel to lonesome dove there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings jon voight did a creditable job as call barbara hershey was a terrific clara and the new characters like gideon walker and agostina vega were well rendered and believable louis gossett jr deserves special mention as the horse wrangler isom pickett the film made me care about the characters and i don t ask any more than that from an actor it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it s predecessor it is worth viewing in it s own right'\n"," b'i wasn t really interested in seeing step up but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this

worth seeing that if i loved movies like dirty dancing take the lead and save the last dance that i should love step up eh what the heck i guess every movie in some way has it s right to a view br br well you know those movies i just mentioned up top dirty dancing take the lead and save the last dance well put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that s what you have not to mention if you ve seen those movies well frankly you have seen step up because channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step how will they ever fall in love if they are so different after all this is their chance to step up to the passion the mystery and the lust of the dance br br ok that was a silly plot explanation but like i said as long as you ve seen those movies i mentioned or even if you just saw the plot you get the movie i don t understand how it actually has a 5 5 rating i bet it s those channing lovers lol i m kidding with you guys but it s all good i guess i just didn t get what others did with the passion the mystery that is the dance oh antonio bandares where are you when we need you br br 4

didn t have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand what s going on in caprica from what i have read in the net they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men and at least in my case it worked br br however i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot'\n"," b'well it turned out as i expected visual overload but nothing else added to the original what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick initially this awoke my interest but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywood like product and b made the whole storyline improbable the 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward and included no time storms or any bogus of that sort it just stated that when you come home after a long journey things might have changed a bit earth might have fallen in the hands of apes for example like many old movies it s main ingredient was suspense hell does anyone understand that word these days in this burton movie an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie but at what cost surely the images are overwhelming and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape culture even ape music but what s wrong br br first the suspension of disbelief is made very hard because the apes have a lot of hollywood human traits i refer especially to ari and the slave trader these traits include emotional skills like irony sarcasm and an overtly displayed array of subtle emotions it makes you forget that the apes are apes which is essential br br second the humans talk of course we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn t made the ape human role switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that dr zira has in him so no need for things like human rights activists or ape human love in order to explain things br br third the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility but is a necessary twist in the new movie since capt davidson has to play the hollywood let s save the whole world and have a good ending for everyone and still make it to the lounge bar for a cool diet coke character oh my god will they never learn i new it from the start when there was only one guy who got lost they were in need of a hero and then the script writers go on reasoning we need one guy so why would one guy get lost because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm implausible but it s necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes since in these modern and politically correct times we can t have a xenophobic ape hater like charlton heston s 68 character loose on the screen let s give them a bubblegum version br br fourth okay the general twist of the original discovering the truth of the 1968 film to the modern version he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab apes developed their society where heston simply discovered that just somehow the apes overtook the earth while he was away is nicely done the second battle part comes as an anti climax that s because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot nice try but the chill you feel when davidson and you discover that he s lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle part br br fifth the ending for chrissakes who came up with that a davidson crashes twice with his escape pod which seems an unsteerable object while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully come on who d believe that if the pods are really small space crafts davidson simply flies off into space at the end and not merely escape vessels he might have managed a safe landing at least once no and what about that ending i mean in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth but here the whole movie takes place on a distant planet and suddenly the same there s a thade statue ape culture is on earth how come did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically flew into the time storm and colonised earth before davidson s mission took off why is thade worshiped stupid stupid stupid br br helena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape but i d expected no less i preferred her ape above estella warren as a human but maybe i got some loose wire in my head nevertheless the only convincing apes were tim roth as thade wonderful and ari s household ape the ex general but i forgot his name br br nonono a lot of things could and should have been added altered to the 1968 pic but not the plot at least not in that way it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining it was nicely tongue in cheek and caricatured don t stylize everything'\n"," b'cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy it was a reflection of high school life back in the day i attended coolidge high in washington d c from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge cooley high getting high shooting dice chasing girls basement parties and fights that sums up high school life for many in d c back in the day i can t forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s the hits just kept coming however cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times cooley high is definitely a

disappointment of the year just like the short moongirl the film missed its marks several times during the movie it made attempts at humor it sets you up for the laugh instead of making you laugh it leaves you feeling empty the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films they weren t funny unless you were five and the acting felt similarly terrible i ve seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen and i ve believed it but not in this film not for a second br br this film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty artwork and though the script is totally workable and the special effects quite beautiful it has no heart to it and fails miserably i left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater i felt hallow and miserable and still haven t gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from it i love independent film i encourage people to view independent films to support them but not this film this film shouldn t have been made at least not like this why did the director miss the marks so clearly they were clearly setup not just the humor but the emotions the drama even the lines were poorly timed and delivered it was like the film walked on three

pretty much completely visually the film s not great the cinematography gore except for a couple scenes and overall direction all fail it s simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster but that s about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems unimportant the killer isn t cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid it s a bit boring overall for a film done by a few ucla film students for 90 000 which would be over double that today the dorm that dripped blood isn t a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces it just cannot compare don t expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to

brothers made a lot of these types of films attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty this movie is quite gritty with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school the rules at the reformatory are simple enough work hard and keep your mouth shut step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson dudley digges br br cagney s role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory on the outside he s still nominally in control of a criminal racket the film s attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this br br warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled crime school featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role and billy halop in the frankie darro part if you re partial to the dead end kids you ll probably like the latter film better since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey huntz hall bobby jordan and gabriel dell however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too with bogart s warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters in mayor madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagney s character br br curiously a lot of james cagney s early films aren t commercially available so you ll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics or source the film from a private collector personally i can t get enough of this kind of stuff and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties'\n"," b'this two part tv mini series isn t as good as the original from 1966 but it s solid the original benefited from a huge number of things it was all in black and white it had a great jazz score and it was filmed at the real locations including the home of the doomed clutter family that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character itself br br this remake was filmed in canada which i guess doubles okay for kansas the story tries to be as sympathetic to perry as it dares to and eric roberts plays him as a somewhat fey person his homosexuality barely hidden the gentler take by roberts doesn t quite work in the end though because it s hard to believe that his version of perry smith would just finally explode in a spasm of murder whereas robert blake s take on smith left you no doubt that his perry smith was an extremely dangerous character br br anthony edwards was excellent as the bombastic big mouthed and ultimately cowardly dick hickcock the brains of the outfit his performance compares very well to scott wilson s role in the original movie br br since this is a longer movie it allows more time to develop the clutter family and in this regard i think the 1996 movie has an advantage the clutters are just an outstanding decent family they ve never harmed another soul and it is just inexplicable that such a decent family is ultimately massacred in such a horrifying way it still boggles my mind that after the clutters were locked in the bathroom that herb clutter didn t force out the window so at least his children would have a chance to escape this movie has the thought occur to him but too late from what i read about the real home which is still standing the way the bathroom is configured they could ve opened the counter drawers and effectively barricaded the door which would ve forced the killers to blast their way in but it might ve bought time for some of the clutters to escape why the clutters didn t try this i have no idea br br fans of the book will recognize that this movie takes a lot of liberties with how the crime is committed but not too serious still it s distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case the actors playing the cops led by sam neill and leo rossi are uniformly excellent much better i think as a group than the actors in the original movie they know that to secure the noose around the necks of both of them they have to get them to confess and the officers come to the interview impeccably prepared they had already discovered the likely alibi the phony story of going to fort scott and had debunked every jot of it the officers then let smith hickcock just walk into their trap hickcock is a b s artist who figures he can convince anyone of anything and the officers respectfully let him tell his cover story but when they lower the boom on him he shatters very quickly it s very well filmed and acted and very gratifying to watch because the viewer naturally should loath hickcock in particular by this point a cowardly con man who needs the easily manipulated smith to do his killing for him supposedly hickcock later stated that the real reason for the crime wasn t to steal money from the clutters but to rape nancy clutter at least she was spared that degradation br br the actors playing the clutters are very good kevin tighe as herb clutter in particular the story sensitively deals with mrs clutter s emotional problems most likely clinical depression and mrs clutter displays remarkable inner strength when she firmly and strongly demands that the killers leave her daughter alone from what i ve read the clutters surviving family was particularly bothered by how bonnie clutter was portrayed in the book claiming it was entirely untrue but as an aside both of the killers related to the police how mr clutter asked them to not bother his wife because of her long illness capote might make up that fiction to make the character of bonnie more interesting but certainly the killers had no reason to falsely portray mrs clutter and no doubt much of the conversation in the book duplicated in the movies is right off the taped confessions of the killers so it would ve been nonsensical for herb to have said that and not have it be true'\n"," b'the pilot is extremely well done it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes i don t think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and rachels future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice br br bravo br br a great start to an unbeatable comedy'\n"," b'this miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film they should have let it remain that way br br what a colossal bomb douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here cesar romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette grable sings with a chorus what i ll do to that hungarian br br the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror fairbanks now let s fast forward to 300 years later where grable just married to the count romero faces a similar situation when on her wedding night there is an invasion by hungarian soldiers br br romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives he disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases fairbanks the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when grable meets fairbanks to tell him the good news an enraged romero has annulled the marriage br br this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 as harry davenport a veteran supporting player who is in it died in 1949 this must have been his last film what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career br br walter abel co stars but he can do little with such poor writing the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age i can t fathom what fairbanks was wearing'\n"," b'i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 75 80 of this film was hilarious it s mostly because of brad pitt s performance spot on br br the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all respects i m not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever br br brutal honest gritty all good words to describe this movie br br i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early s violence isn t explained it is explained but they thankfully don t have to go into graphic detail to get their point across br br overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie underrated'\n"," b'this is burt reynolds citizen kane tragically nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching sharkey s machine it seemed to me that he put everything he had into it it is a movie that is in love with movies the opening sequence where detective sharkey single handedly rescues a bus load of hostages is an immensely exciting piece of cinema everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its own a brilliantly achieved effect it looks cold tense and dangerous on mr reynolds streets the precinct house looks dirty and tired full of desperate people on both sides of the law shouting cursing out trying to do deals or just stay alive into this underworld descends the recently demoted sharkey a reward for a bungled drugs bust caused by a corrupt cop he and his team are part of the vice squad information they pick up concerning a crooked politician leads them into the world of high class call girls and ruthless drug barons watching the apartment of one such call girl rachel ward sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall i know i know and when a woman s body is found with its face shot off in one of the rooms he thinks its her well i did say it was a movie that loved movies the scene where she walks in on him works beautifully even if you have seen the original the film is full of good touches i particularly like charles durning s war story subtly acted and shot in sharp contrast to sharkey s abduction and torture which is suitably harsh and brutal i must mention vittorio gassman and henry silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever they are full on every time they re on screen and are no loss to society when their time comes mr silva s end being extra special indeed as has been mention this is a clint eastwood movie that clint never made the biggest compliment i can pay sharkey s machine is to point out that in my opinion clint eastwood couldn t have made a better job of it the soundtrack is of an equally high standard featuring sarah vaughan joe williams julie london chet baker and other top class artists randy crawford s street life plays behind the title sequence and i can never hear it without in my mind s eye seeing sharkey striding along the sidewalk like other correspondents i have never understood why this film was a bit of a flop i hope it is due for a critical revision particularly at a time when so many cop movies and shows without a quarter of its energy freshness and sheer joie de vivre are lauded from the rooftops if you re ever tempted to think of burt reynolds as a burnt out one trick pony put sharkey s

t like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable gunbuster is rather unique to sci fi anime in that it s actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn t help but love it gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around'\n"," b'don t see this movie bad acting and stupid gore effects a complete waste of time i was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks

the plot was more cohesive than most nothing could be farther from the truth this movie is one huge non sequitur it is an affront to the noble b western films of the 30 s i have seen many of wayne s early lone star and republic westerns and this one is easily the worst br br the bad guy is known as the shadow for crying out loud initially the shadow s scheme is holding up open sided stage coaches simultaneously his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory then they decide to move on to bank robbery to do this they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun no explanation of why that s necessary or how he got that neato little toy br br no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes br br he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wall safe knock knock who s there he is apparently clairvoyant because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him they knock on the wall the safe opens and presto he s there i can just imagine that he has met them face to face and says i have some secret nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed meet me at the wall safe and i ll give em to you just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is like most of the elements of this mess never explained br br he has a nifty tunnel to the ol hollow stump across the street from which vantage point various of his baddies perform assassinations he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe but out in the main room br br when not behind the safe he hangs out on his cow less ranch masquerading as rancher matlock we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch two brothers and assumed the identity of one the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930 s nyc judging by her wardrobe and she apparently never met her real uncle because he dupes her too br br if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats you need to see this movie here the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white head bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired it s like a game of pick up basketball only wayne has them tying bandanas round their heads instead of just taking off their shirts br br perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife the erst while niece on the front porch of their home

mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it s

screenings of it on italian tv many years ago and again a few times on tv while in hollywood br br the film marked ford s first of nine collaborations with henry fonda and is also a quintessential example of ford s folksy americana vein a beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work the courtroom sequences and eventual revelation in its second half still pack quite a wallop apart from giving stalwart character actor donald meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorney br br fonda is of course perfectly cast as a bashful inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become president fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film most notably in franklin j schaffner s the best man 1964 and sidney lumet s fail safe 1964 and it s surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of lincoln since in his view that was like playing god br br it is interesting to note here that ford had

that the opening sequence was pretty good fairly standard for this kind of film but pretty good anyway but as the film progressed i began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing each sequence seemed to take hours the reason for this could have been that by now the film had already bored me to tears nothing was happening other than endless accusations peppered with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fit of bad temper well after wading through what felt like a lifetime of these scenes we finally reached the big finale an all singing all dancing demonstration

champagne to a good house wine br br bernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him martineau is vulnerable and doesn t act rationally he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn t commit but all the evidence points to the contrary br br the other great character in the film is dora the photographer it s clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies simone renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film suzy delair playing jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like brignon the old lecher br br the film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together'\n"," b'i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film was vh 1 treading on hollow ground here i mean harris and quinn don t really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me it s far from the exploitation film i expected instead it s a character study a low key whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn it s hard if not impossible to capture what we once had and what has passed us by'\n"," b'once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesn t work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero he s not bad but he s really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he s not bad he s just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn t funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power br br i can t really recommend the film its worth a shot if you re a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment'\n"," b'this film is just a shame orlando florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like vancouver s rise to prominance the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon br br i will try to be as honest as possible i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to give a new spin on the boy band craze after all both n sync and the backstreet boys come from this area but the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the amatuer actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written br br also a problem is the choice of jokes many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring some of the concert scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also don t seem to move the story along in any way br br i had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres quickly comedy isn t his strong suit but its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area its just a shame that right now he s infamous not famous br br'\n"," b'brian keith as cole wlikerson and richard jaeckel as wade matlock make excellent villains they just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible and sneer sexily at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends it s a pity that goody goody glenn ford gets in their way'\n"," b'you can find an anti war statement here without looking too hard that layer is hackneyed or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war stripped of judgement that layer is completely uninteresting br br or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall s one liners but that s just a coating for commercial mastication br br you can try to view this as a realistic vietnam war film but ask any veteran and he ll swat down that notion most vets will say it stinks br br or view it as a will he or won t he morality play nothing rich there either br br where i found the value was in the superb self reference coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions the war to fit the greatness of the skilled multi dimensional actor playing a great man br br brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character the studios were uncomfortable with his acting method yet he always excelled and won accolades the generals are uncomfortable with kurtz s unsound methods in spite of his strategic genius br br so coppola makes a movie all about brando s greatness to hammer on the point he places himself in the movie as hopper a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras to spout his praises brando himself is only seen in half light and silhouettes brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor s power and he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation oh yes the horror br br other pieces of interest the great use of point of view camera perspectives including being in the firefight long before private ryan the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip br br don t get caught in the outer layers the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self reference'\n"," b'comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times chappelle s show the daily show colbert report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr katz then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful mencia and now sarah silverman br br this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny colbert report but can be horrible mind of mencia it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn t funny a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that s common we don t need 25 minutes of it when a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view br br perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i m very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should ve never made it past the unaired pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show'\n"," b'anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs event there s about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring bland by the book tv drama clich s bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies so i m not going to complain about that silly science can be fun to watch if it s executed in an amusing fashion what kills this movie is it s 10 subplots all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot the one character that is entertaining to watch in category 6 is tornado tommy despite being a very annoying stereotype br br note that i also didn t bother commenting on special effects their quality should come as no surprise br br not recommended']\n","-----------------------\n","label:  [0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n"," 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
